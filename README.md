# Advent20 🎅🏻
Hacky solutions to [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) problems in Rust 🦀

I'll see about structuring the code properly later on - so far I've just been writing in a blank main.rs file and renaming it when it works.

Later on, I intend to rewrite some of the solutions in F# and Python as a learning exercise.
