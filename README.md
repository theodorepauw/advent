# Advent20 🎅🏻
Hacky solutions to [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) problems in Rust 🦀

I'll structure the code properly later on - so far I've just been writing in blank main.rs files and renaming them after they solved the problems.

I may add some F# / Python solutions in this repository later on as well.
